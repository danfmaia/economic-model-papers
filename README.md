# Economic Model Papers Repository

Welcome to the **Economic Model Papers** repository!

This repository is an open platform for collaborative research focused on economic models. It hosts papers that integrate theoretical discussions with practical implementations, including code, simulations, and data. We aim to advance economic understanding through shared knowledge and collective effort.

## **Purpose**

- **Collaboration:** Foster a community where researchers, economists, and practitioners can work together on model-centric economic papers.
- **Transparency:** Provide open access to research papers, models, code, and datasets.
- **Education:** Serve as a learning resource for those interested in economic modeling and policy analysis.
