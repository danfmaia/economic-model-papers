# **Economic Model Papers Repository**

Welcome to the **Economic Model Papers** repository! This platform serves as an open resource for collaborative research on economic models, combining theoretical discussions with practical implementations, simulations, and data. Our goal is to advance economic understanding through shared knowledge and collective effort.

## **Purpose**

- **Collaboration:** Foster a community where researchers, economists, and practitioners work together on model-centric economic papers.
- **Transparency:** Provide open access to research papers, models, code, and datasets.
- **Education:** Serve as a learning resource for those interested in economic modeling, simulations, and policy analysis.

## **Repository Structure**

Hereâ€™s an overview of the key directories and files:

- `README.md`: This file; contains an overview of the repository and its purpose.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Guidelines for contributing to the repository.
- `LICENSE`: Licensing information.
- `papers/`: Directory for model-centric economic papers (each paper has its own subfolder with related files such as code, data, and appendices).
  - Each paper has its own **README.md**, providing a detailed description of the research, methodology, and structure of the paper.
  - Subfolders within each paper directory include:
    - **paper/**: The main paper and appendices.
    - **code/**: Simulation scripts, sensitivity analyses, and models.
    - **data/**: Calibration data, input parameters, and simulation results.
    - **figures/**: Visualizations such as plots and graphs from simulations.
- `future-paper-template/`: Templates for new papers, appendices, and associated files (ready for use by contributors).
- `common-resources/`: Shared resources across papers.
  - **code-snippets/**: Useful code snippets and scripts for economic modeling.
  - **data/**: Common datasets for modeling.
  - **references/**: Key academic papers and references for further reading.

## **Papers**

This section contains the research papers and their associated materials. Each paper has a dedicated subdirectory, with a detailed entry file (`README.md`) outlining its objectives, structure, and instructions for running simulations or analyses.

- **Current Papers**:
  - **[A Mathematical Model for Progressive Adoption of Universal Basic Income in the United States](papers/UBI-progressive-adoption-model-in-USA/README.md)**

As new papers are added to the repository, they will be listed here with links to their respective `README.md` files for easy navigation.

## **How to Contribute**

We invite contributions in the form of:

- **New Papers**: Submit a new model-centric economic paper following our template.
- **Improvements**: Propose improvements to existing models and papers.
- **Datasets and Code**: Share useful datasets, code snippets, or scripts for simulations.
- **Feedback**: Join discussions and provide feedback.

Please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for detailed instructions on how to get started.

## **Templates for New Papers**

If you're looking to create a new paper, start by copying the template files in the `future-paper-template/` directory. Each paper is organized into subfolders to maintain modularity:

- **paper/**: Write your paper and appendices here.
- **code/**: Include simulation scripts or any other necessary code.
- **data/**: Upload calibration data, simulation results, or other datasets used in your research.
- **figures/**: Store all your figures and charts generated from your models.

---

## **Common Resources**

This section contains useful resources available for all papers:

- **code-snippets/**: Reusable Python scripts for common economic models (e.g., Cobb-Douglas, linear regression).
- **data/**: Common datasets (e.g., GDP, population, inflation data) used across multiple papers.
- **references/**: A list of academic papers, research, and datasets that are relevant to model-centric economic papers.
