### **Appendix B: Data Requirements and Calibration Guidelines**

This appendix outlines the data requirements and guidelines for calibrating the model. The actual data collection and parameter estimation are pending and present an opportunity for collaborative efforts.

#### **B1. Data Requirements**

- **Macroeconomic Indicators:**
  - GDP, consumption, investment, government spending, and tax revenues.
- **Labor Market Statistics:**
  - Employment levels, wage rates, labor force participation rates.
- **Demographic Information:**
  - Population size, growth rates, age distribution.
- **Behavioral Parameters:**
  - Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC).
  - Labor supply elasticity (\( \epsilon \)).
  - Tax rates and structures.

#### **B2. Calibration Guidelines**

- **Parameter Estimation:**
  - Suggestions on how to estimate parameters using available data.
  - Recommendations for sourcing up-to-date and reliable datasets.
- **Model Calibration Process:**
  - Steps to align the model with real-world data.
  - Methods for validating the calibration against historical data.
